    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich which is usually prepared with two slices of bread with butter, on a frying pan or skillet, until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melted.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 slices of bread (White or Sourdough preferred)</li>
    <li>2 slices of cheese of your choice</li>
    <li>1 tbsp of unsalted butter</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Set pan or skillet to medium - hi heat. Place butter inside your cooking surface and let it fully melt and bubble.</li>
    <li>Put one slice of bread inside the pan. You can add the two slices of cheese and watch the magic happen while the bread is being toasted in the butter.</li>
    <li>When the bread is golden brown, add the last slice of bread to the unfinished sandwich then flip. Let that side reach golden brown then take it out the pan.</li>
    <li>Cut the sandwich diagonally and enjoy!</li>
